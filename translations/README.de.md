Let's implement a coherent nomenclature for the translation of the technical terms, providing consistency and ease of maintainability for future translators/contributers.

This list is by no means complete, but shamelessly copied from https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/erciccione-monero-localization/wiki/swedish-terminology as a starting point.
